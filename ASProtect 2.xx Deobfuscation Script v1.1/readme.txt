Tracing asprotect 2 SKE stolen and poly code is very difficult because of lots of short obfuscation jumps. This script written by me makes this code much easier to read and trace. There is some more to be done but i switching to immunity so i can make a better script and remove more code.

To use it you should run it at the start of obfuscated code because it will deobfuscate an entire section.

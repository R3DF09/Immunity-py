This script was an exercise in learning the hooking mechanisms and GUI control in ImmLib. The command simply sets breakpoints on some common routines that are used for receiving packets off the network (I didn't hook all of them, but it will be trivial to add more). 

It will create a new window called "Captured Packets" which you can access from the Window menu.
